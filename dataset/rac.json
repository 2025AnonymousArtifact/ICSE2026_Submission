  "Once the system starts up, it checks the vehicle's status value first.\n\nIf the status is greater than 9 but less than 28, or greater than 30 but 49 or less, the system sets the instantaneous driving mileage gradient to 0 and ends.\n\nFor a status of 28, 29, or 30, the system transitions to a new state and sets the instantaneous driving mileage to 10. After this state change, it performs additional checks:\n\n*   If the current stays between -Current Threshold A and Current Threshold A, the system sets the instantaneous driving mileage gradient to 0 and ends.\n*   If the vehicle speed exceeds the speed threshold (kph), the system enters a new state and resets the cumulative discharge distance to 0. Should the energy recovery mileage then exceed 1, it transitions to another state, resets the energy recovery mileage to 0, and ends.\n*   When the cumulative discharge distance is less than the energy recovery mileage, the system moves to a new state and sets the instantaneous driving mileage gradient to 0.\n*   If the vehicle speed is below the speed threshold (kph), the system enters a new state and uses call() to get the cumulative discharge distance. If this distance exceeds 0.1, it transitions to another state, calculates the gradient as (cumulative discharge distance × driving error correction coefficient ÷ 2), and ends.\n*   When the vehicle speed exceeds the speed threshold (kph), the system checks if the instantaneous discharge mileage exceeds the instantaneous driving mileage. If true, it transitions to a new state, sets the gradient to (instantaneous discharge mileage × error correction coefficient), and ends. If false, it enters another state, sets the gradient to (instantaneous driving mileage × error correction coefficient), and ends.",

Additionally, if the vehicle status is 30, switch to driving mode. Next, if the gear is in D or E, set the D_S gear mileage parameter to S gear nominal mileage divided by D gear nominal mileage, and end.
