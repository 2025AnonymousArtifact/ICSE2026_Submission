  "If the patient's heart rate is abnormal, check whether the device is connected normally. If the device is connected normally, start parallel processing. If the patient's blood oxygen is lower than the threshold, check the device calibration status. If the device is adjusted normally, repeat execution, record the patient's heart rate data, stop repeat execution, stop parallel processing. If the device is connected abnormally, initiate an alarm.

  "When an abnormality in sensor data is detected, the data verification process is first started, and data integrity check and data format verification are carried out in parallel in the data verification process. The data integrity check needs to continuously read the sensor data in the loop and perform verification until the data is complete and correct. At the same time, the data format verification confirms whether the data format is compliant according to the preset rules; then the system enters the error processing process, and error logging and error alarm operations are performed in parallel in this process. The error logging needs to be stored in classification according to the timestamp and error type, and the error alarm triggers the corresponding alarm signal according to the error level; finally the system completes all checksum processing operations and enters the standby state to wait for the next data detection.",
